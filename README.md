Welcome to Madlibs, a simple Python game that allows you to create funny and silly stories by filling in the blanks with random words!

To get started, make sure you have Python installed on your computer. Once you've downloaded the game files, open the command prompt or terminal and navigate to the directory where the files are located.

To run the game, simply enter the following command:

The game will prompt you to enter various types of words, such as nouns, verbs, adjectives, and more. Once you've filled in all the blanks, the game will generate a hilarious story that incorporates all of your chosen words!
